principle of least privilage

# 2 Cryptographic failure  
failiure of secure data transfer

https  
use libraries (bcrypt?)

# 3 Injectiom  
introducing hostile code to program  
changing the program execution 

example  
code to steal authentication cookies

XSS

vulnerable to injection when user provided data is not santitized/ validated by the application

# 4 Insecure design  
use security design and patterns by default  
for new application

# 5 Security Misconfiguration  
bad configuration present in 90%  
lack of security controls

# 6 Vulnerable and outdated components   
os  
servers  
DBMS  
APIS  
Runtime  Environemnts  
librariies

# 6 Broken Authentication  
It has come down (standarise frameworks are helping)  
doubt () (oauth wagera ?? ) 
user MFA

# 7 Software and Date integrity failure

using untrusted app plugins (wordpress using compromised plugin)

# 8 Security login and Monitoring failures  
serious impact on digital forensics

# 9 SERVER SIDE REQUEST FOREGERY

Why OWASP and other practical frameworks are important.  
 because they provide standardized, actionable best practices
