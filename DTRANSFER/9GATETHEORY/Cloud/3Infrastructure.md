# Advantages 
Shared infrastructure. 
Web access to the resources. 
Pay-as-per-use model. 
Focus on the core business : rather than on IT infrastructure.

# Disadvantages  
1. Security (major issue of using cloud, thats why bank dont prefer). 
(The IaaS cloud computing platform vendor can get access to your sensitive data)

2. Interoperability issues:
    1. It is difficult to migrate VM from one IaaS provider to the other

3. Breakdowns at the IaaS cloud computing platform vendor's can bring your business to the halt stage
