```python
Gaurav sen had explained it verywell 
```

nosql  
Very fast reads in comparison of sql

Relational  
schema is fixed  
vertical scale up? 
Acid Supported
Typically require joins  
Require ORM  
tables

Non Relational  
horizontal scale up?  
Acid generally not supported, expect in MongoDb
Typically dont require joins  
Mongodb documents map directly to ds of the languages  
vary:
    document? doubt 
    K v 
    graph  

Generaaly these db are according to use case  
k v for very fast reads
    
Easily scalable
Flexible
fast reads
5. Null null null in sql, no data to be stored in nosql
Fast dev

Disadvantages  
Relational

Non relational  
=> takes lot of storage
Update and delete is slow (only reads are fast)
=> in general don’t maintain acid
Don’t maintain consistency constraints ?  
Not when structured data banking app

doubt Whole data need to come vs less data in NOSQL

give example of Different types of nosql database

        
 2. Graph based
    Fraud detection
Neo4j

    1. Document based
Mongodb, couchDB
