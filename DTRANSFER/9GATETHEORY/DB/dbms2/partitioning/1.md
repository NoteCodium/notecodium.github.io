Sharding  

Whats the difference from partitioning?  

technique to do horizontal partitioning ?  
we also have to introduce a routing layer / load balancer

bad when your data is spread over different db instances (analytical type of queries, scatter-gather problem)

Sharding is Horizontal scaling

# How to decide which data go in which shard

1. hash function  
for an ecomerce website, we have to find orders for a person, so customer id is a good basics tp do our sharding in comparison of order id

2. we can store customer id and shard id

# Advantages  
1. scalibility 
    more data
    more queries  

2. Fault tolorence  


# Disadvantages  
non uniformity of data  => resharding  

Queries may be across shards

sql db dont support it by default, you have to implement you own logic at the application layer  
Sql and vertially scalable, nosql are horizontally scalable

# ShardKeys

male female  
first character of last name

# tinder  
geographic location
