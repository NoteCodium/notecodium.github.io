"What is the Agile methodology, and how is it
different from the Waterfall model?"

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on delivering small, functional parts of the software (called increments) frequently and adapting to changing requirements.

Key Principles of Agile:
Customer Collaboration: Close interaction with stakeholders to ensure the product meets their needs.
Frequent Delivery: Software is delivered in short iterations, typically 1–4 weeks (called sprints in Scrum).
Flexibility: Agile embraces changes in requirements, even late in development.
Cross-functional Teams: Developers, testers, and business analysts work together closely.
Continuous Feedback: Regular feedback ensures alignment with goals.
Focus on Working Software: Delivering functional software is prioritized over extensive documentation.

Example Frameworks in Agile:
Scrum: Involves sprints, daily stand-ups, and roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner.
Kanban: Focuses on workflow visualization and continuous delivery.
XP (Extreme Programming):
 pair programming and   
 test-driven development.

What is a Sprint?
A sprint is a short, time-boxed period in the Scrum framework during which a team works to complete a specific set of tasks (usually from the product backlog) to achieve a sprint goal. Sprints are at the core of Scrum, enabling teams to deliver incremental value quickly and adapt to changing requirements.

Key Characteristics of a Sprint:
Fixed Duration: Typically lasts 1 to 4 weeks.
Time-Boxed: The duration is fixed and cannot be extended.
Defined Goal: Each sprint has a clearly defined objective called the sprint goal.
Incremental Delivery: Results in a potentially shippable product increment at the end.
