The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for designing, developing, testing, and deploying software. It ensures high-quality software is delivered efficiently and meets business needs.

Phases of SDLC with Examples:
1. Planning
Objective: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Activities:
Identify business requirements.
Perform feasibility studies (technical, economic, legal, etc.).
Create a project plan.
Example:
A company wants to build an e-commerce platform. In this phase, stakeholders decide on features like product catalogs, payment integration, and delivery tracking.
A feasibility study determines if the existing infrastructure can support such a system.

2. Requirement Analysis
Objective: Gather and analyze software requirements.
Activities:
Consult stakeholders to document functional and non-functional requirements.
Create a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Example:
Functional Requirement: The system must allow users to search for products by name or category.
Non-functional Requirement: The system should load pages in less than 2 seconds.

3. Design
Objective: Architect the system and prepare technical designs.
Activities:
High-Level Design (HLD): Overall system architecture.
Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design of individual modules or components.
Example:
HLD: Decide on a microservices architecture with separate services for user management, inventory, and payments.
LLD: Design a database schema with tables like Users, Orders, and Products.

4. Implementation (Coding)
Objective: Convert design into working software by writing code.
Activities:
Developers code each module or component.
Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code.
Example:
Developers write the backend logic in Java (Spring Boot) and the frontend in React to build the e-commerce platform.
APIs are developed to fetch product details or process payments.

5. Testing
Objective: Verify the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
Activities:
Perform different testing types: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).
Fix identified bugs.
Example:
Unit Testing: Ensure the "Add to Cart" functionality adds the correct product.
System Testing: Verify the platform handles concurrent user logins during a sale event.
UAT: Stakeholders test the platform and confirm it works as expected.

6. Deployment
Objective: Release the software to a production environment.
Activities:
Deploy the software to servers.
Perform post-deployment checks.
Example:
The e-commerce platform is deployed on AWS using CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
DNS configurations are updated so users can access the platform via a domain name like www.myecommerce.com.

7. Maintenance
Objective: Ensure the software continues to function correctly post-deployment.
Activities:
Monitor system performance.
Fix bugs or issues that arise.
Implement enhancements or updates as user needs evolve.
Example:
After deployment, customers report that the "Order History" feature isn’t displaying correctly. Developers fix the bug and release a patch update.
New features like "Wishlist" are added based on customer feedback.

Can you explain the phases of the SDLC with examples?

Verification and Validation (V & V)

Functional Requirements
Describe functionality or system services

NFR

These define system properties and constraints e.g. 
reliability, 
response time and 
storage requirements. 


Constraints are I/O device capability, system representations, etc.
