These are the specific functionalities or features a system must have to meet the user’s needs. They define what the system should do.

Characteristics:
Describe specific actions or operations of the system.
Focus on the business logic of the system.
Can be easily mapped to use cases or user stories.
Examples:
A user can log in using their username and password.
The system should allow users to upload and download files.
The application must calculate the total sales and generate monthly reports.
A search feature must allow users to filter results by date, category, or keyword.
How Functional Requirements are Validated:
Through testing (unit testing, integration testing).
Directly verifiable (e.g., if a feature works as expected).

2. Non-Functional Requirements
These define the system's quality attributes or the way the system performs its functions. They describe how the system should behave.

Characteristics:

Impact the user experience indirectly.

other key words


The system should handle 10,000 concurrent users.
Response time must not exceed 2 seconds under peak load.
The application should be available 99.9% of the time.
Data encryption must be used to ensure security during transmission.

How Non-Functional Requirements are Validated:
Through performance testing, load testing, security testing, etc.
Measured using metrics (e.g., response time in milliseconds).
