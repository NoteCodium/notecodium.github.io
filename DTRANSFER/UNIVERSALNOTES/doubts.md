Whats the advantage of @NoArgsConstruct`or when Java always creates one?


You need a default constructor (constructor without any argument) in entities. This is needed because JPA/Hibernate uses the default constructor method to create a bean class using reflections. If you don't specify any constructor (nor Lombok annotation), Java will generate a default constructor (automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors have been defined for the class). But if you add a constructor with parameters (or @AllArgsConstructor), then you'll need to add a no args constructor (or @NoArgsConstructor) as well, for JPA/Hibernate to work.

It means if there is a custom Constructor, default constructor is not generated?

```python
Why only INTEGER can be used generics
```

Can you discuss the code change for killing the bookkeeperThread? 
When we initiate shutdown, we have to make sure all the jobs which are currently in jobsQueue are completed i.e. jobsQueue is empty and the current tasks being executed by the threads of the threadPool is also completed, untill then we have to make the bookkeeperThread running
