import static:

Direct Access to Static Members: As we discussed before, import static is a special type of import that allows you to directly access static members of a class in another class without using the class name as a prefix.

Full Queue: If the queue is full, put() will block (wait) until space becomes available to insert the element. This means the calling thread will pause execution until the queue is no longer full.
