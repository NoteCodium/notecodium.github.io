{% raw %}
if you can reverse any two numbers in a list, the array can be sorted or if the array is already sorted.

you have to make sure n frequency is whether even or odd can be shared by a and b, it is ok if one receives 1 more than other

```python
abs(one-two)<=1
```

== the order matters in vector
{% endraw %}
