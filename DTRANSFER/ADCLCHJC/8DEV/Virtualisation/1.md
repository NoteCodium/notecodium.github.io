Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of physical resources, such as servers, storage devices, networks, or operating systems. It allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical hardware, enabling better resource utilization, flexibility, and cost savings.

Virtualization is achieved using software called a hypervisor, which abstracts the hardware and creates isolated virtual environments called virtual machines (VMs) or containers

Resource Optimization:

Maximizes the utilization of hardware by sharing resources across multiple virtual machines.
Cost Efficiency:

Reduces the need for physical hardware, lowering infrastructure and maintenance costs.
Scalability:

Easily scale up or down by creating or removing virtual machines.
Flexibility:

Allows running different operating systems and applications on the same hardware.
Isolation and Security:

Each virtual machine is isolated, reducing the impact of system failures or security breaches.
Disaster Recovery:

Virtual machines can be backed up, migrated, or restored quickly in case of failures.

Hypervisor: A software layer that sits between the hardware and the virtual machines, managing resource allocation and isolation.

Type 1 (Bare Metal): Runs directly on the hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen).
Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on a host operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox).

Types of Virtualization:
Server Virtualization:

Allows multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical server.
Example: Hosting several application environments on one machine.
Desktop Virtualization:

Allows users to access virtual desktops from any device, decoupling the operating system from the physical machine.
Example: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
Storage Virtualization:

Pools physical storage from multiple devices into a single virtual storage unit.
Example: Network-attached storage (NAS), Storage area networks (SAN).
Network Virtualization:

Creates virtual networks by abstracting physical networking hardware.
Example: VLANs, Software-Defined Networking (SDN).
Application Virtualization:

Runs applications in isolated environments without being installed on the underlying operating system.
Example: Docker containers.
