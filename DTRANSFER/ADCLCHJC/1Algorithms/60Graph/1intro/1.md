Simple graph: Graph without any self loop and multiple edges

If a cycle exist in simple graph, its length will be more then >= 3

```python
vector<vector<int>> knight={{2,1},{2,-1},{-2,1},{-2,-1},{1,2},{1,-2},{-1,2},{-1,-2}};
vector<vector<int>> directions={{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
vector<vector<int>> king={{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1},{1,-1},{1,1},{-1,1},{-1,-1}};
```

```python
vector<pair<vector<int>, char>> directions= {{{1,0},'D'},{{-1,0},'U'},{{0,1},'R'},{{0,-1},'L'}};
```

```python
bool isValid(int r, int c , int rr, int cc){
	return r>=0 and r<rr and c>=0 and c<cc;	
}
```

```python
for(int r=0;r<rr;r++){
    for(int c=0;c<cc;c++){
        
    }
} 
```

Edges in worst case   
(v*(v-1))//2 VC2   
O(v^2)

in nm matrix, no of edges. nm*4//2    
each cell have 4 edges which are shared by 2 cells.

You can convert 2d graph to a 1d graph     
map<pair<int,int>,int> m;

Sparse graph having v vertices have    
v sqrt v    
Edges

in the worst case a graph having v vertices can have O(v^2) edges
