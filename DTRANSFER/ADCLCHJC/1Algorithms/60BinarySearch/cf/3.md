solving the equations we get

c=1+b

as these are natural numbers the significance of below number increase

a^2=b+c
since b+c is consecutive, their sum is odd
so a^2 is odd
so a is odd

we could have deduced with the below equation also

a is square root of an odd number so will be odd also

a=sqrt(2*b+1)

b

c=1+b

we have proved a is odd so a=1,3,5............
sqrt(10^9) so we have to see till approx 10^5

1≤a≤b≤c≤n   
1≤n≤10^9   
1≤t≤10^4
