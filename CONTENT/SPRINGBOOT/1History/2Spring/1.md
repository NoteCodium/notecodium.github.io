# How Spring solves the Servlet Problems

![](../../../images/20260108_083148_image.png)

Spring addressed this issue by moving configuration from a central XML file directly into the Java classes themselves using **Annotations** and **Java-based Configuration** .\

Verbosity: For every new Controller or Service, you had to add multiple lines of XML.

Decoupling Issues: The configuration was physically separated from the logic, making it hard to see how a class was actually being used.

No Compile-time Safety: Errors in XML (like a typo in a class name) were only caught at runtime during server startup.

```
public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {
    @Override
    public void onStartup(ServletContext container) {
        // Create the 'root' Spring application context
        AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
        context.register(AppConfig.class); // Point to your @Configuration class

        // Manage the lifecycle of the root application context
        container.addListener(new ContextLoaderListener(context));

        // Register and map the dispatcher servlet
        ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher = 
            container.addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(context));
        dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);
        dispatcher.addMapping("/");
    }
}
```
