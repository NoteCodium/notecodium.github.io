🚨 If you’re a Java / Spring Boot SDE, these questions decide your seniority.🚨

Most Spring Boot apps don’t fail because of syntax errors.

They fail because of things we think we understand… but don’t.

Ask yourself honestly 👇

🔹 Why does a Spring Boot app consume more memory over time?

🔹 How do you detect bean initialization issues in large systems?

🔹 What really happens if @PostConstruct throws an exception?

🔹 Why does @Value injection randomly fail in production?

🔹 How does Spring Boot decide auto-configuration order?

🔹 What are the hidden risks of exposing too many Actuator endpoints?

🔹 Why does your app behave differently after scaling pods?

🔹 How does classpath scanning actually work under the hood?

🔹 Why do duplicate beans appear in multi-module projects?

🔹 Why does your API return correct data but response time fluctuates?

🔹 How do you control thread usage in Spring Boot?

🔹 What happens when application.yml & application.properties both exist?

🔹 Why do custom exception handlers not trigger sometimes?

🔹 How do you handle large payloads without killing performance?

🔹 Why does Hibernate generate unexpected queries?

🔹 How do you debug a deadlock in a Spring Boot service?

🔹 What happens if a BeanFactoryPostProcessor goes wrong?

💡 These are not “theoretical” questions.

They show up in:

🔥 Production incidents

🔥 High-traffic systems

🔥 Senior SDE & Staff interviews

🔥 On-call nightmares
