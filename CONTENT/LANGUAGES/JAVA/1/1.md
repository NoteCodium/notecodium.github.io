2.5e3f  // Float literal with scientific notation
2.5e3 // Double literal with scientific notation


    Float vs. Double: Both Float and Double are used to represent decimal numbers. Double has higher precision and a wider range than Float.
    Best Practice: In Java, Double is generally preferred for decimal numbers unless there's a specific reason to use Float (like memory constraints). Since the problem statement doesn't mention any constraints, Double is the better choice.
