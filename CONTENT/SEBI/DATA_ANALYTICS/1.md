# Import

Import data using Pandas :

pd.read_csv('data.csv') 

reads acsvfile intoDataFrameobject. An important point here is that pandas is smart enough to automatically tell the header row and data type of each field, which make the downstream analyze more efficient.



pd.read_excel():reads an excel file (.xls,.xlsx,.xlsm,.xlsb, and.odffile extensions) into a pandasDataFrame. By default, it only import the first data sheet within the excel file (sample.xlsxhas multiple sheets).
