Based on an analysis of the SEBI Assistant Manager essay topics from 2020 to 2024, a clear pattern emerges. SEBI tends to select topics from four specific "buckets": Core Finance/Banking, Technology’s Impact on Society/Finance, Organizational Behavior/HR, and Burning Social Issues (ESG/Mental Health).

Since the current year is 2026, the essay topics will likely reflect the maturation of AI, the push for sustainable finance, and the evolving Indian economy.

Here are the predicted essay topics for the SEBI Grade A 2026 Exam, categorized by theme:

1. Technology & The Future of Finance (FinTech)

The trend has moved from general "tech in crime" (2020) to "Fin-fluencers" (2023). In 2026, the focus will likely be on AI regulation, data privacy, and algorithmic risks.
