Introduction

Definition

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of sovereign currency issued and regulated by a central bank, designed to function alongside physical cash.

Why now?

The growth of digital payments, decline in cash usage, rise of private cryptocurrencies, and the need for efficient and secure payment systems have pushed central banks to explore CBDCs.

Body

Strengths / Advantages / Opportunities

CBDCs can provide safe, low-cost, and instant digital payments backed by the central bank. They promote financial inclusion by reaching unbanked populations and reduce dependence on cash handling. CBDCs improve payment efficiency, reduce settlement risks, and enhance transparency in transactions. They also create opportunities for innovation in programmable money, cross-border payments, and fintech collaboration.

Weaknesses / Disadvantages / Threats

CBDCs may reduce the role of commercial banks in deposits and payments, affecting their profitability and lending capacity. Privacy concerns, cyber security risks, and operational challenges remain significant. Rapid shift to digital currency may exclude digitally illiterate users. Poor design could also increase centralisation and systemic risk.

PESTEL

Politically, CBDCs strengthen monetary sovereignty and reduce reliance on private digital currencies, while increasing the central bank’s role in the payment ecosystem. Economically, CBDCs lower transaction costs, improve payment efficiency, and support financial inclusion, but may lead to disintermediation of traditional banks and changes in monetary transmission. Socially, CBDCs encourage cashless transactions and financial inclusion, though concerns about surveillance and loss of anonymity may affect public acceptance. Technologically, secure digital infrastructure, blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, and robust cyber security systems are critical for CBDC implementation. Environmentally, digital currency reduces the environmental cost of printing and transporting cash, though energy use from digital infrastructure must be managed. Legally, clear laws are required on data privacy, consumer protection, liability, and the legal tender status of CBDCs to ensure trust and smooth adoption.

Way Forward

CBDCs should be designed with a two-tier model, strong privacy safeguards, and gradual rollout to protect the role of traditional banks while promoting innovation.

Conclusion

CBDCs can accelerate the move towards a cashless society and modernise payment systems. With careful design and regulation, they can coexist with traditional banking while strengthening financial stability and inclusion.
