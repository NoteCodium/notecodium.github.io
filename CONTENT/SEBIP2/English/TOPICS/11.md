> Data Privacy vs. Financial Transparency: Navigating the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) landscape in banking.

ntroduction

Definition

Data privacy in banking refers to protecting customers’ personal data, while financial transparency ensures proper disclosure and monitoring to prevent fraud, money laundering, and financial crimes. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) framework seeks to balance these two goals in a digital banking ecosystem.

Why now?

Rapid digitalisation of banking, increased data sharing, and rising cyber risks have made the need to balance privacy and transparency more critical than ever.

Body

Strengths / Advantages / Opportunities

The DPDP framework strengthens customer trust by protecting personal data and giving individuals greater control over their information. At the same time, it encourages banks to adopt better data governance, secure systems, and responsible data usage. Clear rules create opportunities for innovation in privacy-enhancing technologies, secure data sharing, and compliance solutions. A balanced approach also improves the credibility of the banking system and supports long-term financial stability.

Weaknesses / Disadvantages / Threats

Strict privacy norms may limit data access for fraud detection and regulatory reporting. Excessive compliance requirements can increase operational costs, especially for smaller banks. Poor implementation or unclear guidelines may create confusion, leading to either over-sharing or under-sharing of data. Cyber breaches and misuse of sensitive financial data remain major threats.

PESTEL

Politically, the DPDP framework reflects the government’s effort to protect citizens’ digital rights while maintaining financial integrity and regulatory oversight. Economically, strong data protection builds consumer confidence and supports digital banking growth, but compliance costs and restrictions on data use may affect efficiency and innovation. Socially, increased awareness of privacy rights empowers customers, though concerns remain about surveillance and misuse of personal financial data. Technologically, banks must invest in secure IT systems, encryption, consent management, and data minimisation tools to comply with DPDP requirements, while still enabling real-time monitoring and reporting. Environmentally, digital record-keeping and paperless compliance reduce physical resource use, though secure data storage and processing increase energy consumption. Legally, the DPDP framework introduces clear obligations related to consent, purpose limitation, data security, and penalties, but challenges remain in harmonising privacy rules with financial transparency requirements such as AML and KYC norms.

Way Forward

Banks should adopt privacy-by-design, strengthen cyber security, improve consent mechanisms, and ensure close coordination between privacy and regulatory compliance functions.

Conclusion

Balancing data privacy and financial transparency is essential in digital banking. A well-implemented DPDP framework can protect individual rights while ensuring a safe, transparent, and trustworthy financial system.
