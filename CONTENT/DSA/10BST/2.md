You're given a binary tree. Your task is to find the size of the largest subtree within this binary tree that also satisfies the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The size of a subtree is defined as the number of nodes it contains.



```
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};*/

class Solution {
  public:
    /*You are required to complete this method */
    // Return the size of the largest sub-tree which is also a BST
    int largestBst(Node *root) {
        // Your code here
        
    }
};
```
