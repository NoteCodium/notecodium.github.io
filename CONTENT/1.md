4. When LLMS were trained, no were expecte them to be great at (trainers did not intent to impart them), people belive it can only produce text    
  a. Writing code  
  b. translating

  d. creating poems    
  e. solving maths

    b. Do data engineering    
    c. train the model
    d. analyse it
