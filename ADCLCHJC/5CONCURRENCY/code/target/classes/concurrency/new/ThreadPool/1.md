```python

```

till now in the server example we saw we are spawning a new thread each time q new request comre


but suppose we have cpu that can process only 10 threads 


we have created 100 threads, these threads are objects which are going to take some memory


too much pressure on system also


also there is a cost associated with creating a new thread


torning down (garbage collection) also takes resources


THREAD POOL (Similar to connection pool in DB)


Put all the incoming requests in a queue


tp will take a request 


thread pool work best when each thread is doing equal amount of work


also defining queue of predefined capacity, a consumer producer pattern emerged between client and thread pool hence BlockingQueue





# Thread Death



buggy thread can throw an exception and kill the thread?  
Doubt, whats the point of using error handling then?


# Unobvious benefits of threadPool  


Design benefit: Decouples task submission from task execution
