if removing nothing is helping you have to remove the whole array

unintuitive


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


now makes sense

dp


breaking the problems into smaller subproblems    


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


overlapping sub problems     
![image.png](1_images/image.png)


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


ans=n-dp[0]


base case     
dp[n-1]=0


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


standing on an element you can either take that element or skip that element 


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


but it is not necessary that the second condition of picking the element is always true., there can be less elements behind it then the picked up element 


telling a problem is from dp     
1. Seeing divide and conquer happening or not
2. Seeing overlapping subproblems

![image.png](1_images/image.png)


but there is a catch    


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


we just cant stop caring about c, or the other read characters, but in this way our problem will not be ever solved. so, 1 char we dont care


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


these 3 subproblems are diffferent 


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


ans=dp[0][0]


if non of the character matches with ith red colored, then we can move to i+1 th character


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


![image.png](1_images/image.png)


```python
i+k-1<=n-1
i+k<=n
k<=n-i

if
k>n-i
dp[i][k]=inf
```

```python
i+k-1=n-1
k=n-i
all the remaining characters are colored
dp[i][k]=0
```

```
dp[i][k]=min(pick,skip);
skip=dp[i+1][k-1]
pick=inf;
for(string t: vos){
    len=t.size();
    if(i+len-1<=n-1 and s.substr(i,len)==t){
        pick=min(pick,dp[i+1][max(k-1, len-1)]);
    }
}

dp[i][k]=min(pick,skip);
```
