Sir, I have a doubt in which you considered each flipped version of the envelope as a separate instance, I agree one flipped instance cant go inside the other flipped version, but isnt both of them will go inside a bigger envelope? like 2*4 and 4*2 will go both inside 5*6 and well be counted as two times, but in actual they should be counted once
