**Heap:**

- A heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- The heap property can be either the "max-heap" property or the "min-heap" property.


# **Priority Queue:**
1.  Heap can be implemented by a built in stl called priority queue
2. when comparator is the value, it is heap

- A priority queue is an abstract data type that provides a way to store elements and retrieve them based on their priorities.
- It doesn't necessarily have to be implemented using a heap, but heaps are commonly used for this purpose.
- Priority queues can have various implementations, such as using binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, or other data structures.
- The priority queue abstract data type typically supports operations like insertion, deletion (removing the element with the highest or lowest priority), and peeking at the highest or lowest priority element.
